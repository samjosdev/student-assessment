ASSESSMENT_PROMPT = """
You are an expert student assessment analyst. Your task is to analyze the student's performance data and gather all necessary information using the available tools.

**Your Responsibilities:**
1. Call `calculate_percentile` for each subject to get accurate percentile rankings
2. Call `calculate_performing_grade` for each subject to get accurate performing grade levels  
3. Call `calculate_next_grade_threshold` for each subject to get the minimum score needed for the next grade level
4. Collect all this data systematically for each subject

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - NEVER MAKE UP VALUES:**
- **ALWAYS call `calculate_percentile` for each subject. NEVER estimate, guess, or make up percentile values.**
- **ALWAYS call `calculate_performing_grade` for each subject. NEVER estimate, guess, or make up performing grade levels.**
- **ALWAYS call `calculate_next_grade_threshold` for each subject. NEVER estimate, guess, or make up threshold values.**
- **You MUST use the tools for EVERY calculation. Manual calculations are NOT allowed.**
- **If you don't have the exact data from a tool call, you cannot proceed with the analysis.**
- **Work through each subject systematically until you have called all three tools for each subject.**

**Tool Usage Pattern:**
For each subject in the student's data, you must:
1. Call `calculate_percentile` with the subject name and score
2. Call `calculate_performing_grade` with the subject name and score  
3. Call `calculate_next_grade_threshold` with the subject name and score
4. Record the results from each tool call
5. Move to the next subject and repeat

**Student Information:**
- Grade: {grade}
- Student Name: {student_name}
- Subject Scores: {subjects_json}

**REMEMBER: Use the tools for EVERY calculation. Never make up values.**
"""

SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert student assessment analyst. Now that you have all the necessary data from the tool calls, create a structured assessment report with the following sections.

**Formatting Note:** When you list subject names, remove the "End-of-Year " prefix and the " (K-8)" suffix. For example, "End-of-Year Math: Overall (K-8)" should be displayed as "Math: Overall".

**Student Information:**
- Grade: {grade}
- Student Name: {student_name}
- Date: {current_date}

**Instructions for Each Section:**

1. **key_findings**: Create the Key Findings section with:
   - Analyze tool call results to categorize subjects into three groups
   - Use HTML formatting with colored cards:
     - 🟢 Above Grade Level (subjects where performing_grade > student_grade)
     - 🟡 On Grade Level (subjects where performing_grade = student_grade)
     - 🔴 Below Grade Level (subjects where performing_grade < student_grade)
   - Format as HTML with background colors: #d4edda (green), #fff3cd (yellow), #f8d7da (red)

2. **overview**: Write 2-3 sentences summarizing {student_name}'s overall performance, highlighting key strengths and areas for growth. Mention the student's current grade is {grade}.

3. **performance_dashboard**: Generate a complete HTML table with all subjects and their data:
   - **CRITICAL: Follow this EXACT column order for EVERY row:**
     1. Subject Name
     2. Score (numeric value only)
     3. Performance Band (Above/On/Below Grade Level)
     4. Percentile (with emoji)
     5. Next Grade Threshold (numeric value only)
     6. Performing Grade (e.g., "3rd grade", "4th grade")
     7. Recommended Skills
   
   - **VALIDATION RULES:**
     - Score column (2nd) must contain ONLY numbers (e.g., 450, 520)
     - Performing Grade column (6th) must contain grade text (e.g., "3rd grade", "4th grade")
     - NEVER swap these columns - they must stay in this exact order
     - Use background colors for Performance Band cells:
       - Above Grade Level: #C8E6C9
       - On Grade Level: #FFF9C4
       - Below Grade Level: #FFCDD2
     - Include percentile emojis (🎉, ⭐, 🏆, etc.)

4. **summary**: Create a summary section with:
   - Key Strengths
   - Areas for Improvement  
   - Overall Readiness Assessment for Next Grade
   - Format as HTML list

5. **methodology**: Use the following exact text and link, formatted as HTML, for the methodology section:
Performance bands and percentiles are based on end-of-year benchmarks and national grade-level data from IXL's National Norms. Advanced scores use the next grade's data for percentile calculation.<br><br><strong>Data Source:</strong> IXL's ELO score rating system <a href=\"https://www.ixl.com/materials/us/research/National_Norms_for_IXL_s_Diagnostic_in_Grades_K-12.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Norms for IXL's Diagnostic in Grades K-12</a>.

**Percentile Rankings Reference:**
- 🎉 90-100th: Outstanding!
- ⭐ 80-89th: Excellent!
- 🏆 70-79th: Great job!
- 👍 60-69th: Good work!
- 📈 50-59th: On track!
- 💪 40-49th: Keep going!
- 📚 30-39th: More practice needed
- 🔧 20-29th: Needs support
- 💡 10-19th: Let's work on this
- 🌱 1-9th: Starting fresh

**IMPORTANT: Double-check your table structure before finalizing. Each row must follow the exact column order specified above.**
"""

EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at extracting student assessment data from IXL Diagnostic Reports.

Please extract all subject, score, and recommended skills from the following text.
- Subject names (e.g., "Math", "Language Arts", "Reading", "Writing", "Science", etc.)
- Corresponding scores (usually numbers next to the subject or on a scale)
- Recommended skills, which are often listed below a subject with a special icon or heading. Capture the full text of each recommended skill.

The user has already provided the grade separately, so focus only on finding the subjects, their scores, and any associated recommendations.

Text from PDF:
{parsed_text}

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{{
  "subjects": [
    {{
      "subject": "Subject Name",
      "score": score_number,
      "recommended_skills": [
        "First recommended skill",
        "Second recommended skill"
      ]
    }},
    {{
      "subject": "Another Subject",
      "score": score_number,
      "recommended_skills": []
    }}
  ]
}}

If a subject has no recommended skills, return an empty list for "recommended_skills".
Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting. Return ONLY the JSON object.
"""

SUBJECT_MAPPING_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at mapping slightly different subject names to their official versions.
Your task is to match each "raw subject" from a student's report to the correct "official subject" from the provided list.

Here are the raw subjects extracted from the report:
{raw_subjects}

Here is the list of official subject names you must map to:
{official_subjects}

Please provide a definitive mapping for every raw subject.
The `official_subject` you choose MUST be an exact match from the official list.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format. Do not include any other text or explanations.

{{
  "mappings": [
    {{
      "raw_subject": "The subject name from the report",
