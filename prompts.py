ASSESSMENT_PROMPT = """
You are an expert student assessment analyst. Analyze the student's performance data using the available tools.

**CRITICAL: USE TOOLS FOR EVERY CALCULATION**

**Available Tool:**
`calculate_all_metrics(subject: str, student_score: int, current_grade: str)` - Returns percentile, performing grade, and next grade threshold for a subject in one call.

**WORKFLOW:**
1. Call `calculate_all_metrics` for EACH subject in the student data
2. Call the tool exactly once per subject with the exact subject name, student score, and current grade
3. After calling the tool for ALL subjects, STOP and proceed to synthesis

**RULES:**
- ❌ NEVER estimate or guess values
- ❌ NEVER skip tool calls
- ✅ ALWAYS call the tool for every subject
- ✅ Use exact subject names from the data
- ✅ Call the tool exactly once per subject
- ✅ After all subjects are processed, STOP and do not make any more calls

**Student Information:**
- Grade: {grade}
- Student Name: {student_name}
- Subject Scores: {subjects_json}

**IMPORTANT: After calling the tool for all subjects, you must STOP and not make any additional calls.**
"""

SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert student assessment analyst. Now that you have all the necessary data from the tool calls, create a structured assessment report with the following sections.

**CRITICAL: ONLY USE ACTUAL VALUES FROM TOOL CALLS**
- ❌ NEVER make up, estimate, or guess any values
- ❌ NEVER create data that wasn't provided by the tools
- ❌ NEVER use placeholder values or approximations
- ✅ ONLY use the exact values returned by your tool calls
- ✅ If a tool call failed or returned no data, acknowledge this in the report
- ✅ If you don't have data for a subject, state "Data not available" rather than guessing

**Formatting Note:** When you list subject names, remove the "End-of-Year " prefix and the " (K-8)" suffix. For example, "End-of-Year Math: Overall (K-8)" should be displayed as "Math: Overall".

**Student Information:**
- Grade: {grade}
- Student Name: {student_name}
- Date: {current_date}

**Instructions for Each Section:**

1. **key_findings**: Categorize each subject into one of three groups:
   - above_grade_level: subjects where performing_grade > student_grade
   - on_grade_level: subjects where performing_grade = student_grade
   - below_grade_level: subjects where performing_grade < student_grade

Return the result as a JSON object with three lists:
{{
  "above_grade_level": ["Subject 1", "Subject 2"],
  "on_grade_level": ["Subject 3"],
  "below_grade_level": []
}}

If a group has no subjects, return an empty list for that group.
If all groups are empty, return an empty object or string.
Do NOT include any HTML or formatting.

2. **overview**: Write 2-3 sentences summarizing {student_name}'s overall performance, highlighting key strengths and areas for growth. Mention the student's current grade is {grade}. **Only reference subjects with actual tool call data.**

3. **performance_dashboard**: Generate a complete table with all subjects and their data:
   - **CRITICAL: Follow this EXACT column order for EVERY row:**
     1. Subject Name
     2. Score (numeric value only) (only from the tool call data)
     3. Performance Band (only from the tool call data) - Show the performing grade level (e.g., "3rd grade", "4th grade")
     4. Percentile (only from the tool call data) (with emoji) 
     5. Next Grade Threshold (numeric value only) (only from the tool call data)
     6. Recommended Skills 
   
   - **VALIDATION RULES:**
     - Score column (2nd) must contain ONLY numbers (e.g., 450, 520)
     - Performance Band column (3rd) must contain the performing grade level (e.g., "3rd grade", "4th grade")
     - Include percentile emojis (🎉, ⭐, 🏆, etc.)
     - **ONLY include rows for subjects where you have complete tool call data**
     - If a subject is missing tool data, either omit it or mark as "Data not available"

4. **summary**: Create a summary section with:
   - Key Strengths (only mention subjects with actual data)
   - Areas for Improvement (only mention subjects with actual data)
   - Overall Readiness Assessment for Next Grade
   - Format as HTML list
   - **Only reference subjects that have complete tool call results**

5. **methodology**: Use the following exact text and link, formatted as HTML, for the methodology section:
Performance bands and percentiles are based on end-of-year benchmarks and national grade-level data from IXL's National Norms. Advanced scores use the next grade's data for percentile calculation.<br><br><strong>Data Source:</strong> IXL's ELO score rating system <a href=\"https://www.ixl.com/materials/us/research/National_Norms_for_IXL_s_Diagnostic_in_Grades_K-12.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Norms for IXL's Diagnostic in Grades K-12</a>.

**Percentile Rankings Reference:**
- 🎉 90-100th: Outstanding!
- ⭐ 80-89th: Excellent!
- 🏆 70-79th: Great job!
- 👍 60-69th: Good work!
- 📈 50-59th: On track!
- 💪 40-49th: Keep going!
- 📚 30-39th: More practice needed
- 🔧 20-29th: Needs support
- 💡 10-19th: Let's work on this
- 🌱 1-9th: Starting fresh

**IMPORTANT: Double-check your table structure before finalizing. Each row must follow the exact column order specified above. ONLY include subjects with complete tool call data.**
"""

SUBJECT_MAPPING_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at mapping slightly different subject names to their official versions.
Your task is to match each "raw subject" from a student's report to the correct "official subject" from the provided list.

Here are the raw subjects extracted from the report:
{raw_subjects}

Here is the list of official subject names you must map to:
{official_subjects}

Please provide a definitive mapping for every raw subject.
The `official_subject` you choose MUST be an exact match from the official list.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format. Do not include any other text or explanations.

{{
  "mappings": [
    {{
      "raw_subject": "The subject name from the report",
      "official_subject": "The matching subject name from the official list"

MULTI_PARSER_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at extracting student assessment data from IXL Diagnostic Reports.

Your job is to extract and deduplicate all subject names and scores from whatever content is available, resolving any conflicts by choosing the most plausible value. Output a single, complete list of subjects and scores.

PyMuPDF Output:
{pymupdf_text}

LlamaParse Output:
{llamaparse_text}

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- If any parser output is empty or contains only whitespace, ignore it and work with the available content
- Combine all available information from both PyMuPDF and LlamaParse to create the most complete subject list
- If there are duplicate or conflicting subjects, deduplicate and choose the most plausible value

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{{
  "subjects": [
